#CSCE 3600: Major Assignment 1 â€“ Bitwise Operators

#Group Members:

1. Subhash Galla(Major.c, Major.h and replace.c)
2. Murali Sai Vejendla(Major.c and power.c)
3. Mario Nolasco Cortez(Major.c and palindrome.c)
4. Rome Hatsushiba(Major.c and reverse)

#Project Overview
This project implements a menu-driven program where the user can select from a set of bitwise operations to perform on a given integer less than 2 billion. The operations are:

Power of 2: Determines if a number is a power of 2 or finds the next higher power of 2 using bitwise operators.
Reverse Bits: Reverses the bits of a 32-bit integer and returns the new integer.
Replace Bits: Position from Mask: Replaces a bit in a number with a corresponding bit from a user-provided mask.
Palindrome: Checks if the 32-bit binary representation of a number is a palindrome.

#Group Member Responsibilities

1. Subhash Galla: Implemented the Replace Bit Position from Mask function (`replace.c`).
2. Murali Sai Vejendla: Implemented the Power of 2 function (`power.c`).
3. Mario Nolasco Cortez: Implemented the Palindrome function (`palindrome.c`).
4. Rome Hatsushiba: Implemented the Reverse Bits function (`reverse.c`).

#Known Bugs or Problems: None.

#Group Assessment:
Each group member contributed equally to the project, and all members were responsible for testing and debugging the project.
